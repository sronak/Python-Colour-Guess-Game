# Python Colour Guess Game
This is a simple colour guessing game implemented in Python. The game displays the name of a colour and the player has to guess the colour that corresponds to it. The game is played over a number of rounds and the player's score is recorded.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter package (should be included with most Python installations)

## Usage
To start the game, run the following command:

```python colour_guess_game.py```

When the game starts, a window will appear with a colour name displayed at the top and a number of coloured buttons underneath it. The player must click the button that matches the colour of the text. If the player clicks the correct button, their score will increase by 1. If they click the wrong button, their score will decrease by 1. The game continues for a number of rounds (default is 10, but this can be changed in the code).

At the end of the game, a message will be displayed with the player's final score.
